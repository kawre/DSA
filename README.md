# Data Structures & Algorithms

This Github repo contains my personal implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The repo includes different types of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with the corresponding algorithms for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. Additionally, the repo includes popular algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), and graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm). The implementations are written in Java.
